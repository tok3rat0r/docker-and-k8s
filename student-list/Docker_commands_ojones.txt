This is a Docker training exercise based on the Git repository at https://github.com/diranetafen/student-list

The following procedure was used to complete the exercise:

1. First, the Dockerfile found in /simple-api was written.
2. Next, the Docker image was built with the command "docker build -t pozos-api ."
3. Then, the Docker image was run as a container using "docker run --name pozos-api -d -p 5000:5000 -v $pwd/student_age.json:/data/student_age.json pozos-api"
4. Running the given curl command, we see the expected response:
$ curl -u toto:python -X GET http://localhost:5000/pozos/api/v1.0/get_student_ages
